This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually, but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings.  However, ordinary biases in human reasoning such as hindsight bias make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan prior to observing the research outcomes--a process called preregistration. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are pre-existing.  Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines facilitating a rapid increase in the practice.  Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

  title = {Key Attributes of a Modern Statistical Computing Tool},
  abstract = {In the 1990s, statisticians began thinking in a principled way about how computation could support statistics and statistics education. Since then, the pace of software development has accelerated, advancements in computing and data science have moved the goalposts, and it is time to reassess. Software continues to be developed to help do and learn statistics, but there is little critical evaluation of the resulting tools, and no accepted framework with which to critique them. In this paper, we present a set of attributes necessary for a modern statistical computing tool. This framework is designed to be broadly applicable to both novice and expert users, but the particular focus is on making a more supportive statistical computing environment. A modern statistical computing tool should be accessible, provide easy entry, privilege data as a first-order object, support exploratory and confirmatory analysis, allow for flexible plot creation, support randomization, be interactive, include inherent documentation, support narrative, publishing, and reproducibility, and be flexible to extensions. Ideally, all these attributes could be incorporated into one tool, supporting users at all levels, but a more reasonable goal is for tools designed for novices and professionals to `reach across the gap,' taking inspiration from each others' strengths.},

Funding agencies and journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention, often focusing on the so-called "crisis" of reproducibility. One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help us resolve the contradictions.},

  abstract = {In bioinformatics as well as other compute heavy research fields, there is a need for workflows that can be relied upon to produce consistent output, independent of the software environment or configuration settings of the machine on which they are executed. Indeed, this is essential for making controlled comparisons between different observations or distributing software to be used by others. Providing this type of reproducibility, however, is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which often contain multiple versions. In many fields as wells as bioinformatics, these versions are subject to continual change due to rapidly evolving technologies, further complicating problems related to reproducibility. We are proposing a principled approach for building analysis pipelines and taking care of their dependencies. As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines for the analysis of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Bisulfite-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq. All pipelines process raw experimental data generating reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise apart from using the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own data sets or bioinformaticians who would want to automate parts or all of their analysis. Our approach to reproducibility may also serve as a blueprint for reproducible workflows in other areas. Our pipelines, their documentation and sample reports from the pipelines are available at http://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/pigx},

For computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated, the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (i) requesting data and code from authors and (ii) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal Science after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44\% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26\%.

However, in a world in which measurements are noisy and effects are small, this will not work: selection on statistical significance leads to effect sizes which are overestimated and often in the wrong direction. After a brief discussion of two examples, one in economics and one in social psychology, we consider the procedural solution of open postpublication review, the design solution of devoting more effort to accurate measurements and within-person comparisons, and the statistical analysis solution of multilevel modeling and reporting all results rather than selection on significance. We argue that the current replication crisis in science arises in part from the ill effects of null hypothesis significance testing being used to study small effects with noisy data. In such settings, apparent success comes easy but truly replicable results require a more serious connection between theory, measurement, and data.},

  title = {Re-{{Thinking Reproducibility}} as a {{Criterion}} for {{Research Quality}}},
  abstract = {A heated debate surrounds the significance of reproducibility as an indicator for research quality and reliability, with many commentators linking a ``crisis of reproducibility'' to the rise of fraudulent, careless and unreliable practices of knowledge production. Through the analysis of discourse and practices across research fields, I point out that reproducibility is not only interpreted in different ways, but also serves a variety of epistemic functions depending on the research at hand. Given such variation, I argue that the uncritical pursuit of reproducibility as an overarching epistemic value is misleading and potentially damaging to scientific advancement. Requirements for reproducibility, however they are interpreted, are one of many available means to secure reliable research outcomes. Furthermore, there are cases where the focus on enhancing reproducibility turns out not to foster high-quality research. Scientific communities and Open Science advocates should learn from inferential reasoning from irreproducible data, and promote incentives for all researchers to explicitly and publicly discuss (1) their methodological commitments, (2) the ways in which they learn from mistakes and problems in everyday practice, and (3) the strategies they use to choose which research component of any project needs to be preserved in the long term, and how.},

  abstract = {It is common to summarize statistical comparisons by declarations of statistical significance or nonsignificance. Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary\textemdash{}for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1\% significance level to 4.9\%, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems\textemdash{}that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ``significant'' and ``not significant'' is not itself statistically significant.},

The applied perturbations include translations of the cognate ligand in the binding site by a maximum of 0.1 \AA{} along each coordinate or the permutation of the order of atoms of the cognate ligand without any changes to the atom coordinates. These seemingly inconsequential input changes can lead to as much as 17 kcal/mol differences in the computed binding energy. The calculated binding energies cluster around discrete values, which correspond to specific ligand poses. It appears that the largest variations are observed for target-ligand systems in which there is a possibility for multiple poses with strong hydrogen bonds. The barriers between different poses can appear fractal-like, making it difficult to predict which solution will be produced from a given input. Including protein flexibility in MM-GBSA calculations further increases numerical instability, and the protein strain terms seem to be the major factor contributing to this sensitivity. In such calculations it appears unwise to extend the flexible region beyond 6 \AA.},

The results show that nearly identical ligand input structures can produce dramatically different top-scoring docked poses. Even changing the atom order in a ligand input file can produce significantly different poses and scores. In well-behaved cases the docking variations are small and follow a normal distribution around a central pose and score, but in many cases the variations are large and reflect wildly different top scores and binding modes. The docking variations are characterized by statistical methods, and the sensitivity of high-throughput and more precise docking methods are compared. The results demonstrate that part of docking variation is due to numerical sensitivity and potentially chaotic effects in current docking algorithms and not solely due to incomplete ligand conformation and pose searching. These results have major implications for the way docking is currently used for pose prediction, ranking, and virtual screening.},

  volume = {23},
  issn = {0360-0300},
  abstract = {Floating-point arithmetic is considered as esoteric subject by many people. This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point.},

For many reactions, large uncertainty results from the extrapolation of rate laws to low temperatures. A few reactions have been measured directly at temperatures relevant to Titan's atmosphere. In the present study, we observed the consequences of the reduced uncertainty attributed to these reactions. The global predictivity of the model was improved, i.e., most species are predicted with lower uncertainty factors. Nevertheless, high uncertainty factors are still observed, and a new list of key reactions has been established.},

The simple estimates of the critical numbers of decimal digits that should be saved in the independently rounded correlation coefficients, the average values and uncertainties to save the self-consistency is obtained. The set of high level quality requirements to the computerized presentation of the numerical data on the jointly measured or estimated physical values are formulated. It is argued (once again) that the common standard for presentation of the numerical values of correlated quantities in publications and sites is urgently needed.},

We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.},

Si vous ne pouvez pas transf\'erer vos donn\'ees dans R, vous ne pourrez pas les analyser ! Une fois vos donn\'ees import\'ees, vous gagnerez beaucoup \`a les ranger. Une fois vos donn\'ees rang\'ees, vous passerez bien souvent par une \'etape de transformation. Une fois vos donn\'ees rang\'ees avec les variables dont vous avez besoin, la g\'en\'eration de connaissances reposera principalement sur deux moteurs : la visualisation et la mod\'elisation. Leurs forces et faiblesses sont compl\'ementaires, et toute bonne analyse doit tenir compte des deux.

  abstract = {Docker  est un logiciel libre permettant  facilement de lancer des applications dans des conteneurs logiciels.
Selon la firme de recherche sur l'industrie 451 Research, \guillemotleft{} Docker est un outil qui peut empaqueter une application et ses d\'ependances dans un conteneur isol\'e, qui pourra \^etre ex\'ecut\'e sur n'importe quel serveur \guillemotright. Il ne s'agit pas de virtualisation, mais de conteneurisation, une forme plus l\'eg\`ere qui s'appuie sur certaines parties de la machine h\^ote pour son fonctionnement. Cette approche permet d'accro\^itre la flexibilit\'e et la portabilit\'e d'ex\'ecution d'une application, laquelle va pouvoir tourner de fa{\c c}on fiable et pr\'edictible sur une grande vari\'et\'e de machines h\^otes, que ce soit sur la machine locale, un cloud priv\'e ou public, une machine nue, etc..
Techniquement, Docker \'etend le format de conteneur Linux standard, LXC, avec une API de haut niveau fournissant une solution pratique de virtualisation qui ex\'ecute les processus de fa{\c c}on isol\'ee. Pour arriver \`a ses fins, Docker utilise entre autre LXC, cgroups et le noyau Linux lui-m\^eme. Contrairement aux machines virtuelles traditionnelles, un conteneur Docker n'inclut pas de syst\`eme d'exploitation, mais s'appuie au contraire sur les fonctionnalit\'es du syst\`eme d'exploitation fournies par la machine h\^ote.
La technologie de conteneur de Docker peut \^etre utilis\'ee pour \'etendre des syst\`emes distribu\'es de fa{\c c}on qu'ils s'ex\'ecutent de mani\`ere autonome depuis une seule machine physique ou une seule instance par n\oe{}ud. Cela permet aux n\oe{}uds d'\^etre d\'eploy\'es au fur et \`a mesure que les ressources sont disponibles, offrant un d\'eploiement transparent et similaire aux PaaS pour des syst\`emes comme Apache Cassandra, Riak ou d'autres syst\`emes distribu\'es.},
